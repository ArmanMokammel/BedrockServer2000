# BedrockServer2000
A cross-platform command line Minecraft Bedrock server wrapper

*Some part of the source code were taken from my other repository (https://github.com/BaoUida2000/minecraft-bedrock-server-manager) which was forked from Benjerman's Minecraft Server Manager (https://github.com/Benjerman/Minecraft-Server-Manager).*

## Construction in progress...
This software is still in development process and hasn't been tested so don't expect it to work.

## Screenshots
